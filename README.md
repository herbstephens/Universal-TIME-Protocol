## Introduction
marriageDAO enables two verified humans to get married on chain.  In addition to providing 'Proof of Marriage', marriageDAO provides the operating environment for what is essentially is a two-person DAO: common treasury and multi-sig wallet, governance and on-chain history.

## Features
- **Automated Marriage Proposal and Acceptance:**  Turning getting married on-chain into a few clicks.
- **Unique ENS:**  Sub-domain of marriagedao.eth created for every marriage and updated to registry.
- **Joint Treasury Management:**  Easing the process of managing money in a joint account with a multi-sig wallet.
- **Smart Marriage Registry:**  Offchain registry of married World IDs, useful to dating apps eliminating 'false-singles'.
- **One-click Divorce:**  Simplifying and reducing costs of the divorcing process. 

## Technologies Used & Prizes Sought
- **World:**  "Best Mini App" category. 
- **Chainlink:**  "Connect the World with Chainlink" category. 
- **Filecoin:**  "Best dApps powered by Filecoin Onchain Cloud" category. Filecoin used to manage an immutable, decentralized, privacy-preserving registry of married World IDs that any dating app (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, etc.) can query with one API call.
- **Top Ten Finalist:**
